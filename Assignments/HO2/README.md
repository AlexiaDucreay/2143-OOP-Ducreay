## Definitions

#### Class

>A Class is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions,
>which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. 
> A C++ class is like a blueprint for an object.
>For Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different 
>names and brand but all of them will share some common properties like all of 
>them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc. So here, Car is the 
>class and wheels, speed limits, mileage are their properties.
